# React Native Boilerplate

This project is a React Native boilerplate that can be used to kick-start a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides an architecture optimized for building solid cross-platform mobile applications through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic

## Content ðŸ§³
The boilerplate contains:

- a React Native (v0.64.0) application (in "ejected" mode to allow using dependencies that rely on native code)
- a clear directory layout to provide a base architecture for your application
- Redux (v4.0.5) to help manage state
- Redux thunk (v2.3.0) to persist the Redux state
- React Navigation (v5) to handle routing and navigation in the app, with a splash screen setup by default
- Redux toolkit (v1.5.0) to make redux easier
- Axios (v0.21.1) to make API calls
- Prettier and eslint preconfigured for React Native
- React-native-flipper (v0.75.1) to debug react-native and redux-flipper (v1.4.2) to debug redux
